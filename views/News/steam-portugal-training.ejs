                            <p><strong>Location:</strong> Angra do Heroismo, Portugal</p>
                            <p><strong>Host School:</strong> Escola Basica Integrada de Angra do Heroismo</p>
                            <p><strong>Participants:</strong> Mrs. Pepa Pavlova, Mrs. Kalina Nikolova, Mrs. Annie Pavlova</p>

                        <h3>About the Mobility</h3>
                        <p>In implementation of Project No. 2024-1-BG01-KA121-SCH-000202833 under Erasmus Accreditation for School Education, senior high school teachers took part in the observation of STEAM lessons and robotics club activities.</p>

                        <h4>Classroom Observations</h4>
                        <p>During their visit, the representatives of our school were guests in Information and Communication Technology and Computer Thinking classes. Highlights of these classes were tasks related to an introduction to robotics and programming, and learning about the logical thinking behind programming, namely how computers "think" by creating codes, functions, and patterns.</p>

                        <h4>Robotics Club Activities</h4>
                        <p>The Bulgarian teachers were also acquainted with the activities of the robotics club in the Portuguese school. The exhibition of robots made by students, equipped with Microbit plates with motion sensors was interesting. Making robots out of recycled materials demonstrates an example of not only learning digital skills by students but also enhancing their green skills.</p>
                        
                        <p>Other club activities included:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Building a smart house with Arduino</li>
                            <li>Working on programming kits with Python and Scratch</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Physical and Chemical Properties of Minerals</h4>
                        <p>The mobility program also included a lesson on "Physical and Chemical Properties of Minerals" which showed teamwork in the work of Portuguese students who were tasked with describing different types of minerals in relation to their color, hardness, luster, brightness and magnetism.</p>

                        <h4>Science Center of Angra</h4>
                        <p>Interesting ideas were also borrowed from a visit to the Science Center of Angra:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>"Figures of Cool" Experiment:</strong> Study of vibrating plates and calculating the speed of sound</li>
                            <li><strong>UV Radiation Absorption:</strong> Transmission through different filters, drawing attention to the "Ozone hole" phenomenon</li>
                            <li><strong>Visible Spectrum of Light:</strong> Observation through optical windows with light and diffraction grids</li>
                            <li><strong>Radiation Module:</strong> Interactive experiences proving thermal absorption capacity depends on material color</li>
                            <li><strong>Infrared Radiation Study:</strong> Different filters to study transmission and absorption, connecting to the "Greenhouse Effect"</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>International Space Week Activity</h4>
                        <p>On the occasion of the International Space Week, October 4-10, the Bulgarian team of teachers held a lesson on "Where is the ISS?" The Portuguese students learned about the size of the International Space Station, the speed with which it travels and the time it takes to orbit our planet.</p>

                        <h4>Impact</h4>
                        <p>We look forward to the successfully implemented mobility under the Erasmus+ Program to contribute to the development of practical skills in science and information technology and to help students navigate in the modern digital world.</p>

            <section>
                <p>Teachers from PPMG "Acad. Ivan Tsenov" - Vratsa participated in an international summer school as part of the INSIGHT project - Educational Research Based on Historical Scientific Instruments, implemented under the Erasmus+ program (project № 2024-1-BG01-KA121-SCH-000202833).</p>

                <p>The training focused on the innovative use of historical scientific instruments in education through the STEAM approach. The program included lectures, seminars, and interactive workshops where trainers demonstrated how artifacts from the past could be used as an inspiring resource in modern physics, mathematics, technology, arts, and language lessons.</p>

                <p>During the course, participants worked in teams, creating projects and learning scenarios that combine science history, interdisciplinarity, and practical orientation. Good practices from previous school activities were presented, including visits to science and technology museums. Our teachers actively participated in discussions, demonstrating how theoretical concepts can be linked to real learning activities.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Project Outcomes</h2>
                <p>The mobility resulted in the creation of an e-book aimed at stimulating creativity, critical thinking, and active student participation. It combines scientific knowledge, digital skills, foreign language learning, and historical context. While primarily intended for science and language teachers, it's suitable for anyone seeking ideas for interdisciplinary and inspiring lessons.</p>

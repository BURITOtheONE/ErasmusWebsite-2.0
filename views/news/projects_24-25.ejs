        <p>As part of the ongoing Erasmus+ projects implemented at PPMG "Acad. Ivan Tsenov" — Vratsa, the school's Erasmus Team organized a dissemination seminar for teachers from schools across the Vratsa region. The event showcased the results and experience gained during the current projects and aimed to share practical outcomes with local educators.</p>

        <p>During the seminar, the Erasmus Team — represented by teachers Kalina Nikolova, Pepa Pavlova, Veselka Vylova, Ani Pavlova and Ilonka Vutova — presented teaching materials and project outputs developed by teachers and students who participated in mobilities during the 2024–25 school year. The presentations included practical demonstrations and examples of classroom application.</p>

        <p>The team also shared useful ICT tools incorporating artificial intelligence that were learned during professional development courses and demonstrated how these tools can be integrated into the everyday professional work of teaching staff. The dissemination meeting was well received and generated significant interest from the visiting teachers.</p>

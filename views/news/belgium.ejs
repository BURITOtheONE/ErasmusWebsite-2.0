          Science is all around us - in the smallest particles of matter, 
          in the sounds we hear, and in the light that surrounds us. 
          As part of our Erasmus+ Mobility programme, students and faculty 
          embarked on captivating project activities related to quantum physics, 
          the relationship between physics and music, the interaction between 
          light and matter. Seventeen students from PPMG "Acad. Ivan Tsenov 
          participated in lectures, simulations and hands-on experiments that 
          were hosted by our partners from the UCLL University of Applied Sciences in Dieppenbeck, Belgium.

          One of the main topics was quantum physics - the branch of science that shows us that 
          the world on a microscopic level behaves in a way completely different from classical 
          physics. Under the skillful guidance of university professors, Bulgarian students 
          compared theoretical and experimental results using an experimental setup involving 
          a tube through which electrons pass and a graphite plate, whose cells are sized similar 
          to the size of electrons. The phenomenon of electron diffraction was observed, then the 
          values of the wavelength magnitude were calculated in two ways - through a theoretical 
          formula and through a formula involving experimental results.

          The topic of "Physics and music" was a great interest. 
          Students explored how physics and music are connected by 
          conducting experiments with sound waves, frequencies, and 
          resonance. The topic of how different musical instruments 
          generate sound and what physical laws determine their timber 
          is also considered. And after the theoretical part was followed 
          by a creative performance in which our students demonstrated 
          their talent through several musical performances on piano, guitar and drums.

          The team work continued with experiments with optics 
          in the "Physics and Light" module, which proved that 
          light is not only a basic element of our everyday lives, 
          but also the subject of in-depth scientific research. 
          Light dispersion, interference and diffraction were 
          studied through laboratory exercises. Through simple 
          but effective experiments, it was clearly shown why 
          light moves in a straight line, how light can be separated 
          into spectral colors using prisms, and how solar and lunar 
          eclipses are achieved. The light refraction index, as well 
          as the nature of the reflecting telescopes, were clearly explained.

          As part of the work program, the Bulgarian team 
          visited the Belgian school Spectrumcollege, Beringen, 
          where students participated in STEM-themed project activities. 
          The work took place in mixed teams, which solved logical and 
          mathematical problems, with an emphasis on practical learning. 
          In the Energy Sources workshop, organized and conducted by 
          Bulgarian students, our Belgian partners got acquainted with 
          the different types of renewable energy sources, then answered 
          questions on the topic. They also joined the interactive card 
          game aimed at consolidating the gained knowledge of the meaning 
          of clean energy. In addition to acquiring new knowledge, our 
          students also developed teamwork skills, critical thinking, 
          and a scientific approach to problem-solving.

          This mobility, which is under Project 
          No. 2024-1-BG01-KA121-SCH-000202833, in conjunction 
          with Erasmus Accreditation for School Education KA-121-SCH, 
          has not only expanded the scientific knowledge of students 
          but also inspired them to explore the world around them with 
          curiosity and enthusiasm. Through the relationship between physics, 
          music, and light, participants realized that science is not just a 
          theory but a living and dynamic field that can be explored through 
          experimentation and creativity.

        <p>Within the framework of project №2024-1-BG01-KA121-SCH-000202833 under Erasmus Accreditation for School Education, a group of 15 students from PPMG "Acad. Ivan Tsenov", Vratsa participated in mobility in Istanbul, Turkey. For several unforgettable days from May 19 to 23, 2025, the students visited three partner schools, where together with their Turkish peers they participated in joint lessons in chemistry and physics with interactive activities.</p>

        <p>Among the most interesting moments was the practical work on creating a perfume, based on a preliminary analysis of the formula for percentage content and ratio of ingredients. The students also explored the properties of acids and bases through a creative presentation in poetic form. The experiment called "Volcano" was also impressive — by igniting a mixture of chemical substances, the effect of an erupting volcano is obtained.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Physics projects by partner schools</h2>
        <p>The Turkish students presented an exhibition of physics projects, including:</p>
        <ul class="bullets">
          <li>Models of an inclined surface and a fixed pulley</li>
          <li>Hydraulic cranes demonstrating Pascal's principle</li>
          <li>A model of an electromagnetic train</li>
          <li>A project for generating electrical energy from mechanical energy</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The program also included official presentations by the partner schools, as well as a musical greeting from the school choir, which contributed to the warm welcome and friendly atmosphere.</p>

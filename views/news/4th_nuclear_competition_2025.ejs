          We are pleased to announce that two teams from the "Acad. Ivan Tsenov" Secondary School - Vratsa have qualified
          among the 15 finalists of the prestigious European competition ENEN Secondary School
          Competition 2025, organized by the European Nuclear Education Network (ENEN)
          as part of the ENEN2plus project.
        </p>
        <p>
          This year's competition featured 132 teams from 17 countries. 
          The task was to create a 3- to 4-minute video presenting an application of nuclear science, 
          from energy production and radiation protection to medical technology and space exploration.
        </p>
        <p>
          The teams including students: Katerina Getova, Yoana Yordanova, Tsvetelina Tsonkova and Martin Andreev 
          impressed the international jury with their innovative ideas and creativity, which secured them a place among the finalists.
        </p>
        <p>
          Under the leadership of Ms. Pepa Pavlova and Ms. Ani Pavlova, 
          they will represent Bulgaria at the final competition and science camp, 
          which will be held from July 14 to 18, 2025 in Bologna, Italy.
        </p>
        <p>
          This success is also closely related to the active work of the high school under project No. 2024-1-
          BG01-KA121-SCH-000202833, in connection with the Erasmus Accreditation for School Education KA-121-SCH, 
          aimed at promoting STEM education and international cooperation. Participation in such initiatives creates 
          a solid foundation for the development of scientific culture and innovative thinking in our students.
        </p>
        <p>
          We congratulate the students and their teachers on this exceptional success 
          and wish them inspiration and excellent results in the final stage!

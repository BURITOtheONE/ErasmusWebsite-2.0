    <h2>STR5EAM Erasmus+ @ PPMG - Vratsa</h2>
    
    <p>
      The Secondary School of Science and Mathematics "Akademician Ivan Tsenov" - Vratsa is a holder of long-term 
      accreditation under the Erasmus+ program (KA120-SCH). The main goal of our project is to 
      transform the learning environment through an innovative and interdisciplinary approach to STEM education, 
      complemented by arts and responsible research.
    </p>
  
    <h2>What is STR5EAM?</h2>
    <p>
      STR5EAM is an upgrade of the traditional STEM model that includes five key R-components and the arts (Art), 
      placing students at the center of learning through creation, discovery, and teamwork.
    </p>
  
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Recreation</strong> - learning through games, escape rooms, puzzles and fun science activities</li>
      <li><strong>Reading</strong> - developing functional literacy and understanding of scientific texts</li>
      <li><strong>Robotics</strong> - learning digital and algorithmic skills through robotics</li>
      <li><strong>Relation</strong> - solving real social and environmental problems through STEM projects</li>
      <li><strong>Research</strong> - building skills for responsible research and innovation</li>
      <li><strong>Art</strong> - using visual and performing arts to express scientific ideas</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h2>Our vision</h2>
    <p>
      STR5EAM is an educational model that prepares students not just to acquire knowledge, but to create, 
      communicate, and implement solutions in the real world. The project stimulates creativity, teamwork, and social responsibility.  
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Thanks to Erasmus+ accreditation, students and teachers participate in international training, 
      exchanges and activities that build new horizons and develop key skills of the future.

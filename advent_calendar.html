          An open lesson combining interdisciplinary approach and project-based 
          learning was held by Senior English Teacher Annie Pavlova with the students 
          of IX a class of PPMG - Vratsa. The internship allowed the team of students 
          to demonstrate their gained knowledge and skills in computer science and 
          English through a practical project on the topic "STEM-themed Advent Calendar". 
          Mrs. Pavlova presented the essence of the Advent calendar, which originated 
          in the 19th century in Germany as a tool for children to count the days left 
          until Christmas, and subsequently grew into a popular holiday tradition around 
          the world. In line with the upcoming Christmas holidays, the project was also 
          implemented, which represents an electronic version of the calendar in its 
          traditional visual form, but with creative content and themes that enhance 
          interest in STEM areas developing critical thinking and creativity in children.
        </p>

          The calendar was designed and made by Denislav Tsenov and Martin Petkov, 
          who used the languages Java Script, CSS and HTML to program the product. 
          Raya Stancheva and Desislava Dinkova contributed to the selection and 
          organization of the content. For each day of the calendar, there are 
          interesting facts about famous scientists, discoveries and technologies; 
          easy-to-do at-home experiments; quizzes and links to educational videos.

          The students of class IX a used a public license provided 
          by MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), which allows 
          the product to be distributed and used without the required 
          copyright. The project has been uploaded to the GitHub platform, 
          where anyone can download and share the code.

          Guests of the lesson were the students of VIII b 
          and XI a grades and their teachers Lydia Dinkova, 
          Lyudmila Jenkins and Stanislava Kamenova. 
          They all took part in solving the calendar challenges 
          and were intrigued by the small experiments and 
          STEM-related tasks - building models and logic tasks.

          The idea of the lesson and the main highlights, 
          which include elements from various subjects 
          (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) are 
          related to the realization of the goals set in the Erasmus 
          Accreditation for school education, in connection with which 
          Project No.2024-1-BG01-KA121-SCH-0002833, which enables teachers 
          and their students to develop practical learning. are skills 
          in science and information technology.

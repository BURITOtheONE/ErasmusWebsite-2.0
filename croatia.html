          Teachers of PPMG Acad. Ivan Tsenov ", Vratsa took part in mobility under 
          the Erasmus+ program, which was implemented from November 25 to November 30, 
          2024 in Croatia . The program included lectures and workshops, providing practical 
          experience and observation on the application of nuclear and medical physics. Mobility 
          has been carried out in several significant institutions in Croatia, including leading 
          universities, research centers and hospitals.

          A main highlight was a visit to the Ribro Hospital in Zagreb, 
          where participants had the opportunity to learn about the latest 
          applications of medical physics, including the use of radiologic and nuclear 
          technologies for diagnosis and therapy. The visits included observation of 
          work in radiology and oncology wards, as well as participating in discussions with medical professionals.

          As part of the mobility, the participants visited the Faculty of 
          Science and Mathematics at the University of Zagreb and the University of 
          Split, where innovative research and curriculum in the field of nuclear 
          physics were presented. It provided an opportunity to exchange experiences with 
          faculty and students, as well as to discuss future collaborations.

          One of the key points of the program was 
          the visit to the Ruger Boskovic Institute, a leading 
          scientific research institution in Croatia. Participants 
          had the opportunity to learn about current research projects, 
          including in nuclear and medical physics, and observe high-tech 
          equipment and laboratories.

          The program also included a visit to the RIT Croatia 
          (Rochester Institute of Technology) campus, where an interdisciplinary 
          approach to learning combining innovation and practical application in science 
          and technology was demonstrated. The Bulgarian team presented its experience for 
          an integrated approach to education by creating links between different disciplines, 
          which stimulates creativity, critical thinking and the application of knowledge in 
          real life. The lesson “The Northern Lights: a Fusion of Science, Myth and Magic” 
          that we presented, integrates these elements and demonstrates the STEAM approach to education.

          This mobility, which is a project in connection with 
          Erasmus Accreditation for School Education KA-121-SCH, 
          provided participants Pepa Pavlova, Lyudmila Jenkins, 
          Dimitrina Milcheva and Annie Pavlova with valuable knowledge, 
          experience and contacts that will be of great benefit to their 
          professional development and for the introduction of new practices 
          in the field of science and education.

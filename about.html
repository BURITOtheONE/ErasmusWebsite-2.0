        <p>
          The Secondary School of Science and Mathematics "Akademician Ivan Tsenov" - Vratsa is a holder of long-term 
          accreditation under the Erasmus+ program (KA120-SCH). The main goal of our project is to 
          transform the learning environment through an innovative and interdisciplinary approach to STEM education, 
          complemented by arts and responsible research.
        </p>
      
        <h2>What is STR5EAM?</h2>
        <strong>
          STR5EAM is an upgrade of the traditional STEM model that includes five key R-components and the arts (Art), 
          placing students at the center of learning through creation, discovery, and teamwork.
        </strong>

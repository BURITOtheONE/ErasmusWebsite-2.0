          Students of IX in class and their teachers 
          Dimitrina Milcheva (Chemistry and JSC) and 
          Maya Genkova (English) held a binary lesson 
          on the topic: "Chemistry in us and around us". 
          During the lesson, the ninth-graders from PPMG - 
          Vratsa applied the practically learned knowledge 
          of chemistry by explaining it in English.

          Four teams researched and proved the presence of 
          various nutrients - carbohydrates, proteins, starch, 
          and vitamins. Using chemical tests, they have successfully 
          identified the ingredients of various foods and drinks, 
          while demonstrating good English proficiency. Each team 
          completed the tasks with enthusiasm and scientific approach.

          Guests of the lesson were: Mrs. Annie Georgieva - Senior 
          Expert in Natural Sciences and Ecology at the Russian Federation - 
          Vratsa, Mrs. Rosenka Kabatliiska - Senior Foreign and Native Language 
          Expert and the School Director Mrs. Tatiana Vasileva. They expressed 
          their satisfaction with the commitment and hard work of the students. 
          "These types of lessons foster critical thinking, experimental approach 
          and teamwork, which is essential for young people's future development," 
          the experts shared.

          The binary lesson has shown that science and language skills can be complemented 
          in an interesting and attractive way. Students not only learned more about chemical 
          processes in and around us, they also improved their ability to present scientific 
          information in English. Initiatives like these prove that education can be useful, 
          fun, and inspiring at the same time.

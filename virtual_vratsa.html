          Students from PPMG "Acad. Ivan Tsenov" - Vratsa, members of the Erasmus+ Club with leaders Pepa Pavlova 
          and Ani Pavlova, embarked on an unforgettable virtual journey through the natural beauty of their region. 
          At the Knigini Center, they had the opportunity to experience Bulgaria's first-of-its-kind VR film 
          “Destination Vratsa - Greatness and Beauty in 360°”, created on the idea of the Knigini Association 
          and showcasing ten of the most remarkable natural landmarks in the Vratsa region. In addition, 
          the participants enjoyed the cozy atmosphere of the café-bookstore with a charitable cause, 
          discovering how education, culture, and innovation can intertwine in a unique shared experience.

          As part of the activity, the students were also given a creative task - to write an essay in 
          English reflecting on their impressions of the virtual journey. These essays will be compiled 
          and published in an e-book or another resource, allowing them to share their experiences and 
          inspiration with a wider audience.

          This initiative is a vivid example of the mission of the Erasmus+ programme - 
          to promote learning through innovation, cultural diversity, creativity, 
          and cooperation, preparing young people for a more connected and responsible European future.

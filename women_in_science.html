          Proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015, 
          the International Day of Women and Girls in Science is 
          celebrated on February 11 each year. This day provides 
          an opportunity to recall the key role women and girls 
          play in the science and technology community and the need to enhance their participation.

          The girls from the Erasmus+ club celebrated the day by 
          putting together an exhibition of nine posters they made, 
          telling the stories of famous world and Bulgarian women 
          scientists. Increased participation of women brings diversity, 
          fresh perspectives, and talent in research and scientific 
          undertakings. They have invested their creativity, which women 
          and girls possess, which is important in accelerating the progress of science.

          Bridging the gender gap in STEM is essential for leveraging 
          diverse talents to address relevant global challenges, 
          including healthcare and climate change.
        </p>

          The exhibition is related to the realization of the goals set 
          in the Erasmus Accreditation for School Education, in connection 
          with the implementation of Project No.2024-1-BG01-KA121-SCH-000202833, 
          in which the principles of gender equality lie.

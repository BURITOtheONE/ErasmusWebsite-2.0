          Within the framework of their professional development, 
          the teachers from PPMG "Akad Ivan Tsenov" - Vratsa, Mrs. 
          Veselka Valova, Deputy Director and Senior Mathematics Teacher, 
          Mrs. Annie Pavlova, Senior English Teacher and Mrs. Pepa Pavlava, 
          Project Coordinator and Senior Physics and Astronomy Teacher, 
          took part in the trainings under the Erasmus+ program, targeting 
          STEAM - based teaching methods, as well as the application of 
          artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual reality (VR) in 
          language learning. These international courses were held 
          in Tallinn, Estonia in implementation of Project No. 
          2024-1-BG01-KA121-SCH-000202833 on Erasmus Accreditation for 
          School Education KA-121-SCH. The training has provided a valuable 
          opportunity to refine teaching practices, enhance digital competencies 
          and apply innovative pedagogical approaches.

          STEAM-related modules (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) focused 
          on interdisciplinary, project-based learning that encourages creativity, collaboration 
          and critical thinking among students. Teachers had the opportunity to try hands-on 
          activities and digital tools supporting STEAM principles, as well as exchange 
          experiences with colleagues from other European countries.

          AI and VR training introduced participants to the latest technologies that transform 
          language learning into an interactive and personalised process. Artificial intelligence 
          tools demonstrated how adaptive systems can meet students’ individual needs and provide 
          immediate feedback, while VR has created opportunities to practice language skills in a 
          realistic virtual environment.

          Teachers worked in teams and, alongside their peers, discussed the challenges and 
          benefits of using the STEAM approach in education, shared their experiences and 
          perspectives on integrating AI and VR in the education process, and explored potential 
          strategies for introducing these technologies into the classroom. As a result of working 
          together, the teams developed lesson plans based on the idea of using modern technology 
          in the learning environment.

          Course participants got acquainted with the specifics of the Estonian education system 
          and visited the Ehte Humanitaargumnaasium High School, where their Estonian colleagues 
          shared their intelligent solutions for educational innovation.

          Participation in the Erasmus + courses contributed significantly to the professional 
          growth of teachers and the modernization of the learning process in their educational 
          institution. The knowledge and experience gained will be used to create a more engaging, 
          inclusive and future-oriented learning environment for students. An electronic handbook 
          for teachers, including the developed lesson plans, is about to be issued, which will be 
          available in the school's e-library and published on the PPMG - Vratsa website.
